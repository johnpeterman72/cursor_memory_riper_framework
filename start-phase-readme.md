# Cursor IDE: START Phase Framework

A structured approach to project initialization for AI-assisted development in Cursor IDE.

## Overview

The START Phase provides a systematic process for initializing new projects or major components before entering the RIPER workflow. It focuses on establishing a solid foundation through requirements gathering, technology selection, architecture definition, and memory bank setup.

## Key Features

- **Requirements Gathering**: Structured approach to collecting project requirements
- **Technology Selection**: Framework for evaluating and selecting appropriate technologies
- **Architecture Definition**: Process for designing high-level system architecture
- **Project Scaffolding**: Templates for establishing consistent project structure
- **Environment Setup**: Guidelines for configuring development environments
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Process for setting up the memory bank with baseline information

## Getting Started

1. Copr thestart-phase-framework.md to your Cursor IDE project
2. Begin with the START phase using the `/start` command in the AI agent window
3. Follow the structured process for project initialization
4. Complete the deliverables checklist
5. Transition to the RIPER workflow for ongoing development

## Related Framework

This framework is designed to work with the [Enhanced AI Assistant Framework](./README.md) which provides the RIPER workflow for ongoing development after initialization.

## Documentation

See the full [start-phase-framework.md](./start-phase-framework.md) file for complete documentation on using this framework.
