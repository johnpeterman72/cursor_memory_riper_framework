# Cursor IDE: START Phase Framework

A structured approach to project initialization for AI-assisted development in Cursor IDE.

## Overview

The START Phase provides a systematic process for initializing new projects or major components before entering the RIPER workflow. It focuses on establishing a solid foundation through requirements gathering, technology selection, architecture definition, and memory bank setup.

## Key Features

- **Requirements Gathering**: Structured approach to collecting project requirements
- **Technology Selection**: Framework for evaluating and selecting appropriate technologies
- **Architecture Definition**: Process for designing high-level system architecture
- **Project Scaffolding**: Templates for establishing consistent project structure
- **Environment Setup**: Guidelines for configuring development environments
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Process for setting up the memory bank with baseline information

## Getting Started

1. Copy the start-phase-framework.md to your Cursor IDE project and add it to the Cursor rules (make sure you also add the cursor_enhanced_rule_set.md to the Cursor rules as well)
2. Begin with the START phase using the `/start` command in the AI agent window
3. Follow the structured process for project initialization
4. Complete the deliverables checklist
5. Transition to the RIPER workflow for ongoing development by typing the command "ENTER RESEARCH MODE"

## Custom Modifications
1. If you work in a standard technology stack, you can edit the [start-phase-framework.md](./start-phase-framework.md), file to include these files and references
2. You can easily customize the folder structure, departing from the Standard Project Scaffold Template in [start-phase-framework.md](./start-phase-framework.md), by editing the file before you run the start command.


## Related Framework

This framework is designed to work with the [Enhanced AI Assistant Framework](./README.md), which provides the RIPER workflow for ongoing development after initialization.

## Documentation

See the full [start-phase-framework.md](./start-phase-framework.md) file for complete documentation on using this framework.
