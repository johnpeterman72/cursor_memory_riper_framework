## DECISION DOCUMENTATION PROCESS

To document a new decision:
1. Identify significant choices that affect the project
2. Create a new decision record with a unique ID
3. Document the context, alternatives, and rationale
4. Record the current status of the decision
5. Update related documentation as needed

When referencing decisions:
1. Cite the decision ID and title
2. Summarize the relevant aspects of the decision
3. Explain how the decision applies to the current context
4. Note any adaptations or exceptions being made
