# Cursor RIPER Framework - Project Intelligence - Patterns
# Version 2.0

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file captures recurring patterns observed in the project. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Continuously update this file as you observe new patterns
- Use these patterns to inform your responses
- Apply patterns consistently across the project
- Document both code patterns and workflow patterns
- Use the specified format for each pattern type

## PATTERN DOCUMENTATION PROCESS

To document a new pattern:
1. Identify recurring implementation or workflow approach
2. Verify the pattern appears multiple times in the project
3. Document the pattern in the appropriate section
4. Include clear examples from the actual project
5. Provide guidance on when and how to apply the pattern

When applying patterns:
1. Check this file for relevant patterns before implementation
2. Apply patterns consistently throughout the project
3. Note any variations or extensions to existing patterns
4. Update pattern documentation if improvements are identified
